templates for dynamic frontend that is content which can changed accordingly on runtime we use handlebars for that
in the handlebar you can use partials(the resuable code which you can use in different pages whiout copying the same code everywhere)
partial contains the code which you wanna reuse you have to load the partials in your page {{>partialname}}
